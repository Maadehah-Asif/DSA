# Question 3: Logical and Comparison Operators
# 3. You have the following variables:
#   x = 5
#   y = 10
#   z = 5
#   - Use a comparison operator to check if x is equal to z and if x is less than y.
#   - Use logical operators to check if both conditions are true (i.e., x == z and x < y).
#   - Print out the result of the logical AND operation.

x =5;
y=10;
z=5;
print(x==z);
print(x==z and x<y);
