# Question 2: Operators and Calculations
# 2. Given the values a = 10, b = 3, and c = 5, calculate the following:
# - a raised to the power of b (exponentiation).
# - The result of floor division of a by c.
# - The modulus of a and c.
# - The result of a AND b in binary.

a=10;
b=3;
c=5;

print(a**b);
print(a//c);
print(a%c);
print(a&b);
