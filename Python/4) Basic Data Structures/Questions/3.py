# Question 3: Tuple Operations
# 3. Create a tuple of numbers (10, 20, 30, 40, 50).
#    - Retrieve the second item in the tuple.
#    - Try to modify the tuple (e.g., change an element) and handle the error.
#    - Create a new tuple by adding another tuple and print the result.
#    - Use the 'count()' method to find the occurrences of a value in the tuple.
