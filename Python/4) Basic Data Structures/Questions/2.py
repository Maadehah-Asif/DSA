# Question 2: Set Operations
# 2. Create two sets:
#    - Set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}
#    - Set2 = {3, 4, 5, 6}
#    - Use the 'union()' method to combine the sets and print the result.
#    - Use the 'intersection()' method to find the common elements and print the result.
#    - Use the 'difference()' method to find elements in Set1 but not in Set2 and print the result.
#    - Remove an element from Set1 using the 'discard()' method and print the updated Set1.
