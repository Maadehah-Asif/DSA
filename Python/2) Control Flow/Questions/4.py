# Question 4: Nested Loops
# 4. Write a nested loop:
#    - The outer loop should iterate over a list of adjectives and the inner loop should iterate over a list of fruits.
#    - Print the combination of each adjective and fruit (e.g., "red-apple", "big-banana").


a1=["a","b","c"];
a2=[1,2,3];

for i in a1:
    for j in a2:
        print(i+"------"+str(j));
