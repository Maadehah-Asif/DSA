# Question 1: Function Definition and Calling
# 1. Write a function that takes two parameters (name and age) and prints out a greeting message: 
#    "Hello, <name>! You are <age> years old." 
#    Call this function with different names and ages.

def func(name, age):
    print("hi,"+name+"! You are "+str(age)+"years old.");

func("ali",7);
